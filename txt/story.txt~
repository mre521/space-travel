Story
=====

You man a ship as it flies through space to its destination.
Along the way you encounter obstacles that would be detrimental
to your ship, such as asteroids and black holes.

Luckily, your ship is armed with an energy weapon which can break 
asteroids into smaller, less harmful pieces. Black holes, however, 
devour your shots and pull you in gravitationally so they must be
avoided at all cost.

To aid you in your journey, the destination planet sends various
ship upgrades with the potential to upgrade your weapon or give 
you shielding against asteroids. It is your responsibility to 
collect ship upgrades as they drift by if you want them.

In the event you are destroyed, your home world will regenerate
you a limited number of times. After a number of regenerations 
you are deemed too incompetent to make the journey and they send
someone else: 
    --> Game Over.
