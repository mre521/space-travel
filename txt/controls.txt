Controls
=======

To control your ship:
    A or left arrow key rotates counter-clockwise.
    D or right arrow key rotates clockwise.
    W or up arrow key accelerates in the direction the ship points.
    S or down arrow key does nothing because allowing reverse
        acceleration would be too easy.
 
    Holding space bar fires energy weapon shots.

    The K key destroys your ship if you really want to.

Menu Navigation (If you haven't already figured out):
    Up/down arrow keys navigate menus.
    Right arrow key/enter enters menus. 
    Left arrow key/escape exits menus.

That's about it.
