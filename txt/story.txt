Story
=====

You man a ship as you navigate through space to your destination.
An interstellar tunnel created by your home world keeps you on
course and allows near light-speed travel. It is not perfect,
however. Along the way you encounter obstacles that would be 
detrimental to your ship, such as asteroids and black holes.
These objects are not able to be excluded from the tunnel.

Luckily, your ship is armed with an energy weapon which can break 
apart asteroids. Black holes, however, devour your shots and pull 
you in gravitationally, so they must be avoided at all cost.

To aid you in your journey, the destination planet sends various
ship upgrades with the potential to upgrade your weapon or give 
you shielding against asteroids. It is your responsibility to 
collect ship upgrades as they drift by if you want them.

In the event you are destroyed, your home world will regenerate
you a limited number of times. After a number of regenerations 
you are deemed too incompetent to make the journey and they send
someone else: 
    --> Game Over.
