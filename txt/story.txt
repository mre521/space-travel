Story
=====

    You man a ship as you navigate through space to your destination.
The distance you travel depends on whether you are assigned to an 
"Easy", "Medium", or "Hard" trip. An interstellar tunnel created by 
your home world keeps you on course and allows near light-speed travel. 
    
The tunnel is not perfect,however. Along the way you encounter 
obstacles that would be detrimental to your ship, such as asteroids 
and black holes. These objects are not able to be excluded from the 
tunnel. The amount of these obstacle also depends on difficulty.
    
Luckily, your ship is armed with an energy weapon which can break 
apart asteroids. Your world rewards you with points for every 
asteroid you destroy. Black holes, however, devour your shots and 
pull you in gravitationally, so they must be avoided at all cost. 
    
To aid you in your journey, the destination planet sends ship upgrades 
with the potential to upgrade your weapon or provide shielding against 
asteroids. It is your responsibility to collect ship upgrades as they 
drift by if you want them.
    
In the event you are destroyed, your home world will regenerate you a 
limited number of times. After a number of regenerations you are deemed 
too incompetent to make the journey and they send someone else: 
    --> Game Over.

You may also attempt to show your proficiency in the "Endurance" test 
whereby you survive as long as you can. There is no way to 'win' in 
this case, only to travel the furthest distance and collect the most
points. After you have been regenerated an amount of times:
    --> Game Over.
